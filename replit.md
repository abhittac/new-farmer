# Harvest Direct: Farm-to-Table E-commerce Platform

## Overview

Harvest Direct is a full-stack e-commerce application that connects consumers directly with traditional farmers, enabling them to purchase authentic, preservative-free products like coffee, spices, and grains. The platform focuses on showcasing the stories behind traditional farming methods and providing a seamless shopping experience. The application now includes SMS OTP verification for enhanced security during user registration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React-based SPA (Single Page Application) using modern UI components from shadcn/ui and styled with Tailwind CSS.

2. **Backend**: Express.js server handling API requests and serving the frontend.

3. **Data Layer**: Drizzle ORM with a PostgreSQL database (configured but not fully implemented).

4. **State Management**: Combination of React Query for server state and React Context for local state.

5. **Routing**: Uses Wouter for client-side routing.

The application is designed to be deployed on Replit with configurations for both development and production environments.

## Key Components

### Frontend

1. **Pages**:
   - Home (`client/src/pages/home.tsx`): Landing page showcasing featured products and farmers
   - Product Detail (`client/src/pages/product-detail.tsx`): Detailed view of a specific product
   - All Products (`client/src/pages/all-products.tsx`): Product catalog with filtering capabilities
   - All Farmers (`client/src/pages/all-farmers.tsx`): Directory of farmers with their stories
   - Checkout (`client/src/pages/checkout.tsx`): Order processing and payment

2. **Components**:
   - UI Components: Extensive collection of reusable UI components using shadcn
   - Cart: Shopping cart functionality with add/remove/update capabilities
   - ProductCard: Card displaying product information
   - FarmerCard: Card displaying farmer information
   - Layout: Common layout wrapper for consistent header and footer

3. **Context**:
   - CartContext (`client/src/context/CartContext.tsx`): Manages cart state and operations

### Backend

1. **API Routes** (`server/routes.ts`):
   - Product routes: CRUD operations for products
   - Farmer routes: Retrieve farmer information
   - Cart routes: Manage shopping cart actions

2. **Data Storage** (`server/storage.ts`):
   - In-memory storage implementation for development
   - Interface prepared for database integration

3. **Data Schemas** (`shared/schema.ts`):
   - Product schema
   - Farmer schema
   - Cart schema
   - Testimonial schema
   - Newsletter subscription schema

## Data Flow

1. **Product Browsing**:
   - Frontend makes API requests to fetch products/farmers
   - React Query caches the results
   - User interacts with products (filtering, viewing details)

2. **Shopping Cart**:
   - User adds items to cart
   - CartContext manages local cart state
   - Cart data is synchronized with server via API calls
   - Cart persists using session ID stored in localStorage

3. **Checkout Process**:
   - Form data validation using React Hook Form and Zod
   - Order submission via API
   - Success/failure handling

## External Dependencies

### Frontend
- React and React DOM for UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI)
- React Query for data fetching
- Wouter for routing
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Hook Form and Zod for form validation

### Backend
- Express.js for API server
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Vite for development and building

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit:

1. **Development Mode**:
   - `npm run dev` starts both backend and frontend in development mode
   - Vite provides hot module reloading

2. **Production Mode**:
   - `npm run build` builds both frontend and backend
   - Frontend assets are built to `dist/public`
   - Backend is bundled to `dist/index.js`
   - `npm run start` serves the production build

3. **Database**:
   - Configured to use PostgreSQL, but currently using in-memory storage
   - Database URL is expected in environment variables

The deployment is configured via `.replit` file, which specifies the necessary Replit modules (Node.js, PostgreSQL) and deployment settings.

### Migration to Replit Environment (July 23, 2025)

Successfully migrated the project from Replit Agent to the standard Replit environment:

**Backend Configuration Changes:**
- Updated CORS configuration to support Replit domains (.replit.dev, .repl.co, .replit.app)
- Configured server to bind to 0.0.0.0:5000 for Replit compatibility
- Added proper TypeScript types for Express middleware (@types/cors, @types/morgan)
- Fixed environment variable handling for Replit deployment

**Frontend Configuration Changes:**
- Updated VITE_API_URL to use empty string for same-origin requests
- Fixed API communication issues by removing localhost dependencies
- Resolved TypeScript type issues in components

**Key Accomplishments:**
- All API endpoints working correctly (products, farmers, categories, cart, etc.)
- Database connection and seed data initialization successful
- Vite development server with hot module reloading functional
- React application loading and displaying data properly
- Full e-commerce functionality maintained including SMS OTP features

**Application Status:**
- Server running successfully on port 5000
- Frontend React application loading components
- API communication working (200 responses from all endpoints)
- Database operations functional with existing seed data
- Unit display system working correctly with proper quantity formatting
- Ready for deployment and further development

### Unit Display Fix (July 23, 2025)

**Issue Resolved:** Product unit display inconsistency where some products weren't showing units properly on detail pages.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created centralized `formatUnit` utility function in `client/src/utils/formatUnit.ts`
- Updated function to include quantity in unit display (e.g., "3 L", "500 Gram", "2 Pcs")
- Modified ProductCard and ProductDetail components to show complete unit information
- Removed duplicate quantity display since it's now integrated into the unit

**Unit Formatting Rules:**
- "l" → "3 L" (shows quantity + formatted unit)
- "kg" → "1 KG" 
- "gram" → "500 Gram"
- "pcs" → "2 Pcs" or "1 Piece" (singular for quantity 1)

**Result:** Products now display prices as stored in database without conversion:
- "₹6.95/500 Gram" instead of "₹0.01/Gram"  
- "₹10.50/3 L" instead of "₹3.50/L"
- "₹12.50/2 Pcs" instead of "₹6.25/Piece"

- Added cancellation tracking fields: cancellationRequestedAt, cancellationReason, cancellationApprovedAt, cancellationApprovedBy, adminNotes
- Extended customer information fields: customerName, customerEmail, customerPhone for better tracking

**Backend API Implementation:**
- Created customer cancellation request endpoint: POST /api/orders/:id/request-cancellation
- Implemented admin endpoints: GET /api/admin/orders/pending/cancellation and POST /api/admin/orders/:id/process-cancellation
- Added comprehensive order cancellation handlers in server/admin/orders.ts
- Integrated proper authentication middleware for secure access

**Frontend Implementation:**

- Built admin management dashboard (/admin/order-cancellations) for processing requests
- Added admin navigation menu item with XCircle icon for order cancellations
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback throughout the workflow

**Security Features:**
